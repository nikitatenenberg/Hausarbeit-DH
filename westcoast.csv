December 25th, the birth of SaturnA homosexual god – now check the historical pattern December 25th, now thought the birth of Christ Was Saturnalia – when men got drunk, fucked each other, then beat their wifeFact is, it was still practiced, 'til they called it ChristmasSo put a gerbil on your Christmas list The Hellenistic Era, Alexander the GreatConquers all the way to India, leavin' four successor states By the 5th century B.C., R-O-M-ESucceeds to be the conqueror of Egypt and Greece But had the threat of the black Phoenicians in Sicily The Punic Wars begin, 264 BC The Black general Hannibal and Carthaginian Peace In 146 B.C., Carthage fell after a 6-month siegeRome sold every citizen to slavery – the first genocide of history And more bisexuality in sight –Julius Caesar was known as ""every woman's husband and every man's wife"" Spartacus Revolt, a slave rebellion that lost Where 6,000 slaves was nailed on a cross Cross? Aw, shit, Jesus Christ, time for some act-rightChristians, get your facts right'Cause Christ was not his name, that's Greek for ""One who is anointed""Yeshua ben Yosef was his name, do Christians know this? So who do you praise? Do you know his name? Or do you do this in vain? Accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave? Peep the description of historian Josephus""Short, dark, with an underdeveloped beard"" was Jesus He had the Romans fearin' revolutionThe solution was to take him to court and falsely accuse him After being murdered by Pilate, how can it be These same white Romans established Christianity? Constantine would later see the cross in a dreamIn his vision, it read ""In hoc signo vinces""""In this sign we conquer"" – Manifest Destiny In 325, he convened the Nicene CreedAnd separated God into three Decided Jesus was born on December 25th And raised then on the third day is a myth Plus to deceive us –Commissioned Michelangelo to paint white pictures of JesusHe used his aunt, uncle, and nephew Subconsciously, that affects youIt makes you put white people closer to God (Yo! Man got game like a motherfucker) True indeed, fuck it, Jihad In the 8th century Muslims conquered Spain, Portugal, and FranceAnd controlled it for 700 years They never mention this in History class 'Cause ofays are threatened when you get the real lesson Moors from Baghdad, Turkey threatened European Christians Meaning, the white way of life; hence the Crusades for Christ On November 25th, 1491 Santiago defeats the last Muslim stronghold, Granada King Ferdinand gave thanks to God for victory And the Pope of Rome declared this date to forever beA day of ""Thanksgiving"" for all European ChristiansNow, listen, when you celebrate ""Thanksgiving""What you are actually celebratingIs the proclamation of the Pope of RomeWho later, in league with Queen IsabellaSent Cardinal Ximenos to SpainTo murder any Blacks that resisted ChristianityThese Moors, these Black men and women were from Baghdad, TurkeyAnd today, you eat the turkey for your ""Thanksgiving"" dayAs the European powers destroyed the TurkeysWho were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers Now fight the power, bitch-ass niggas  Now around this time, whites started callin' us NegroesThat's Spanish for ""black object"" – meaning we're not really people But property, and the triangle trade begins – they seize us Queen Elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named Jesus Stealin' land from the indigenous nativesGave them alcohol, to keep the Red Man intoxicated Whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animalsBut up until 1848, there's documented casesOf whites being the savage cannibals, eating Indians In 1992, it's Jeffery Dahmer They slaughtered a whole race with gunsDrugs, priests, and nuns 1763, the first demonic tactic of biological warfareAs tokens of peace, Sir Jeffery AmherstPassed out clothing and blankets to the Indian communityInfested with Smallpox, knowing they had no immunity Today, it's AIDS – you best believe it's man made 'Cause ain't a damn thing changed – let me explainNow since people of color are genetically dominantAnd Caucasoids are genetically recessiveAnd whites expect to be predominantMeaning survive as a race, then they simply must take precautions That's why they're worried about their future now 'Cause by 2050, almost all the Earth's population will be Brown, then Black So understandin' that, whites counter-react (I'm saying... Man, the fools ain't nothing but A teaspoon of milk in a world color majority) So they created a system To force blacks into an unnatural position That reinforces the position of natural inferiority In addition, created guns and developed the ethnocentric view That God justifies every fuckin' thing they do Condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized And every other culture considered primitive – not true Racism is the system of racial subjugation Against non-whites in every areas of human relation: Entertainment, education, labor, politics Law, religion, sex, war, and economics See, Blacks were 3/5ths of a man, with tax purposes intended You think you're Afro-American? You're a 14th amendment and a good nigga Jews don't salute the fuckin' swastikaBut niggas pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya They never teach about the break of islands like Jamaica But before slaves came here, whites would take a–Pregnant woman, hang her from a tree by her toesSlice her stomach with a knife and let the unborn baby fall to the floorAnd stomp an unborn child in front of all the slaves To inbreed fear, so they'd be scared and behave And not rebel more Understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators I paraphrase historian Ishakamusa Barashango ""Understand that, regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper in such documents as the Constitution or DeclarationThe basic nature of the European American white man remains virtually unchanged""So, check –This is the nature of the threat"

Get in, nigga I'll take you to the pad soon Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom Jumped back in my lowrider Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps One fool bumpin' music for the yamps But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch 'Cause I had the jam on And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon Gimme the nappy and make me happy The ho said, ""Pappy, could you slap me On the ass hard and fast And could please try not to leave a gash?"" I said, ""Yeah, but I don't play sex Without puttin' on the latex"" Slipped on the condom Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son And it came out sort of like confetti In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'  [Chorus] Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? Steady mobbin' Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? There goes the neighborhood Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? Steady mobbin' Have you ever seen such a sight in your life? There goes the neighborhood  [Outro] There goes the neighborhood Get the radio, get the radio There goes the neighborhood"
